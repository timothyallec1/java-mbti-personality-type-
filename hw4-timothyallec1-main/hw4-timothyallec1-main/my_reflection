I believe ISFJ is a good match for my personality. I definitely am
introverted and I let my senses/emotions sway my thoughts and actions.
Despite being led by my feelings, I am a deep thinker and thoroughly process
every action I make throughout the day. I am not spontaneous and I am
very deliberate in what I do. I care about those closest to me and enjoy
keeping a close circle of those I trust the most. Although I am intune with
my emotions, I am unlikely to open up about them.

My strengths include being reliable, observant, hardworking,and enthusiastic.
These are all true because I believe myself to be very hardworking and
enthusiastic about the things I am passionate about. I pay attention to the
smallest things which allow me to gain insight into the things(and people)
around me. My weaknesses include being overly humble, overcommitted, and
reluctant to change. Undoubtedly, I possess all of these traits and I can
attest to them with personal experiences. I internalize negative feelings when
I am in relationships, which lead to issues. Also, I sometimes allow myself
to be taken advantage of by standing up for myself.
